 ### About me 
- My name is Milton and I'm passionate about all things technology. My journey in the world of coding and software development began a few years back, and ever since then, I've been on an exciting adventure of learning, creating, and collaborating.


### What You'll Find Here
- On this GitHub profile, you'll find a variety of projects that reflect my interests, skills, and continuous learning process. I love experimenting with different technologies and frameworks, and as a result, my repositories cover a wide range of topics, from web development to data science, and even some fun side projects.
